# Shuv
A simple client-side mod that allows you to shove your friends and enemies. Keep in mind that the host needs to have the mod installed for it to work!

* 0.2.1: Added a new config option thanks to a suggestion from Adler on Github!
* 1.0.0: Added a config option for RagdollTime.
* 1.0.2: Updated to work with ContentSettings update.
* 1.0.7: Added config syncing via Mycelium with new Power setting 
* 1.0.8, 1.0.9: No more shoving yourself!
* 1.1.0: Take damage from being pushed. Also, finally, fixed self-shoving.

Utilizes `ContentSettings` to allow for easy configuration in Settings. Thanks to `CommanderCat` and `dhkatz` for their amazing work on `ContentSettings`!
